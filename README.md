# Hospital-Network-Management

This mini project aims to provide a network topology for a hospital building for better management of files sharing and maintaining database through LAN system This report describes the network design of Health care management or Hospital. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fiber cable). Giving the IP addresses manually in big organizations is a very tedious task and the chances of error are really high, so for that DHCP is used through which the configuration is automated. Additionally, the communication between the various wards should be maintained. We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology Itâ€™s a general design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage network system.
